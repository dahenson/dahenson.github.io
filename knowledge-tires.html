<h3>Tire Age</h3>
<p>
  When a tire is manufactured in the United States and officially inspected by
  the DOT (Department of Transportation), they recieve a DOT stamp. This stamp
  indicates that the tire is in compliance with DOT and includes the week and
  year it was manufactured.
</p>

<p>
  The first two digits inside of the oval indicate the week of the year, and the
  second two digits indicate the year. In this case, the tire has been
  manufactured in the third week of 2019.

      When we were nearing completion of the popup camper, I realized I hadn't
      checked the tires. If we were going to be able to get on the road, we would
      have to make sure that the tires were in good condition.

      Apparently tire rot can be hard to spot, so we needed another way to
      determine the condition of the tires. Our neighbor Tim was the one that
      enlightened us about the DOT stamp, and it turns out Granny had already
      replaced the two tires and the spare before dropping off the trailer.
