    <p>I've switched my blog... again.  This time it's powered by Pelican, and it doesn't have comments.  If you want to talk, find me on one of the many social networks.</p>
<p>I know I should be content with what I have, but it's so hard not to get restless after a while.  First it was learning to program again, then it was learning how to write a GUI, then it was back to writing a book.  November was when I stopped feeling as wrestless.  I put <a href="http://launchpad.net/agenda">Agenda</a> aside for a little down time while I participated in <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org">NaNoWriMo</a>.  It was a relief to stop thinking in source code all the time, but it was stressful trying to write up a fictional world.</p>
<p>At the start of the year, I funneled a ton of energy into getting a little web series off the ground, but I'm stalled out on that now too.  The desire is there, but my wife and I lack the time and energy to keep the ball rolling.</p>
<p>Now, I'm back at it again trying to figure out what it is I want to do with the precious little time I have.  I'm learning a little Python, I'm pretty much done with Ruby, I'm wanting to do something personally significant maybe.  That's not to say I'm unhappy.  I'm very happy.</p>
<p>I just feel restless.  All pent up with nowhere to go.  Maybe if I blog regularly, I can straighten out my thoughts.</p>
