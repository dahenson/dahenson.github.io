## The History

My brother-in-law gave me his broken Creality Ender 3 v2 3D printer the other
day. I was excited to get it home, confident that I would be able to fix it up
and get back to my normal printing shenanigans. It didn't take long to work
some of the kinks out and run a couple of prints through it. Everything seems
to be humming along nicely, and the prints are coming out clean.

But what do I do with my old trusty Folgertech 2020 i3? Crusty, somewhat
temperamental, and long in the tooth, it's probably hopeful for retirement.
All of those "[vitamins](https://reprap.org/wiki/Category:Vitamin)"--as they call them in the RepRap world--should not go
to waste! So, with a fresh, working printer, I decided I would do the most
sensible thing: print another printer!

The youtuber (youtubist? youtubite?) [Shane (Fugatech)](https://www.youtube.com/@Fugatech3DPrinting) designed a printer based
around the very same Folgertech vitamins I wanted to repurpose. The printer is
called "Mega Tron i3", and you can download the printable parts on the printables
web site: [Mega Tron i3](https://www.printables.com/model/54703-mega-tron-i3)

According to Shane, you should be able to tear down the Folgertech, print the
necessary parts, and build the mega tron from the scraps. I am already
andticipating a few issues with this plan.

First, I seem to recall Shane receiving his printer with a few upgrades already
installed, and I believe he may have added a few upgrades to the printer over the
years. He is definitely not starting from a stock machine, while I definitely am.
Second, he has already stated in the design that the printer is designed to use
an upgraded control board without end stops, which means I either have to add end
stops or upgrade my board.

I also anticipate needing to upgrade my hotend, since the one I have is a little
bit dated.

I'll cross those bridges when I get to them.

## So it Begins

Despite not having all of my marbles together, I went ahead an got started. I've
always liked the idea of building a printer from scratch, which is why I bought
the Folgertech as a kit in the first place.

The other day, I spent an afternoon and completely disassembled my faithful old
Folgertech. It was a good machine. I learned a lot of great lessons about FDM
printing through trial and error with. Like a phoenix, it will be reborn from
the ashes as a more powerful reflection of itself.

Wish me luck, and stay tuned!
