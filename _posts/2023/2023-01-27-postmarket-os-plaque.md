I spent a little bit of time the other evening on a little 3D Printing project
for my new Chromebox. The Chrome logo on the side of the Chromebox is
misleading and I wanted to re-brand it with the logo for the software that it
is _actually_ running.

My inspiration came from a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kG_YKeJDaX8)
in which the creator Scott Yu-Jan is customizing his 3D Printer and he says:

> Step 1: debrand
>
> -- <cite>Scott Yu-Jan</cite>

He then proceeds to spray paint the parts of the printer that are branded to obscure the logo.
Well, I wasn't about to spray paint the nice little black box so I figured I
could at least "re-brand".

My OpenSCAD and FreeCAD skills are still lacking, so I knocked this one out in
Sketchup. The logo is (sort of) free-handed, and may not be exactly right. To
my eyes, it looks pretty close to the original. Overall, I'm pretty pleased with
the result.

I changed the filament at layer 11 (with resolution set to 0.2mm) so that I
could overlay the glow-in-the-dark background with some nice green filament.
I don't have a darker green, but I think the muted colors look nice.
