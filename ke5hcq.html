        <p>
          I’ve been a licensed amateur radio enthusiast since 2006. I have only pushed
          the transmit button on my HT a handful of times, but I’ve always admired
          the community and the depths of the hobby. I hope to explore more ham-related
          activities in the future.

          The only equipment I have is the now classic entry-level Baofeng UV-5R+ handheld.
          I replaced the rubber ducky with a Nagoya NA-701 whip. I use it to talk on the
          local repeaters and check in on the weekly net. I occasionally stand outside
          and listen to the satellites as they fly by, and I hope to talk to other hams
          through a satellite someday.
