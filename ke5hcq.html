      <h2>KE5HCQ</h2>
      <section>
        <p>
          I’ve been a licensed amateur radio enthusiast since 2006. I have only pushed
          the transmit button on my HT a handful of times, but I’ve always admired
          the community and the depths of the hobby. I hope to explore more ham-related
          activities in the future.
        </p>

        <h3>Baofeng UV-5R+</h4>
        <p>
          The first radio I ever owned was the now classic entry-level Baofeng UV-5R+
          handheld. I replaced the rubber ducky with a Nagoya NA-701 whip. I use it to
          talk on the local repeaters and check in on the weekly net. I occasionally
          stand outside and listen to the satellites as they fly by, and I hope to
          talk to other hams through a satellite someday.
        </p>
        <h3>Icom IC-2410a</h3>
        <p>
          This is my current mobile radio. It's a good dual-band transceiver with plenty
          of memory slots for my local repeaters, and adequate power to talk while I'm on
          the road. I just recently had a QSO with someone 30 miles away with this radio
          and a magmount, which was pretty cool.
        </p>
        <h3>Kenwood TM-201A and TM-201B</h3>
        <p>
          I have both models of this radio. The TM-201A can transmit at 25 watts, has
          a very simple interface, and I like using it for simplex communication. The
          TM-201B is nearly identical, but it can transmit at 50 watts. I favor the "B"
          model for our local simplex net.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope to make my own tone module for both of these radios so that I can use
          them as base stations for talking on the local repeaters. <a href="https://zl2pd.com/">Andrew (ZL2PD)</a>
          has designed and published some novel <a href="https://zl2pd.com/CML_PW_50tone_CTCSS_Encoder.html">CTCSS encoder circuits</a>
          for use with radios like this, and I can't wait to build one myself.
