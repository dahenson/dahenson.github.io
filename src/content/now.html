<h1>Now</h1>

<p>
  This is a <a href="https://sive.rs/nowff">“Now” page</a>. It is a brief
  overview of what is happening in my life at the moment.
</p>

<h2 id="living">Living</h2>
<p>I live in Granbury, TX now.</p>

<p>
  My wife and I moved our family to a small(er) town in Texas so that we could
  feel closer to our roots. We both grew up in small(er) towns–hers was
  significantly smaller than mine. There is no idyllic lifestyle to fit every
  human, but as soon as we got out of the city we felt at peace.
</p>

<p>
  I might change my tune in the next 10 years as the DFW urban sprawl overtakes
  and consumes Hood County, but I’ll cross that bridge when I come to it.

<p>
  I currently work for <a href="https://dscout.com">dscout</a> as a software
  engineer.
