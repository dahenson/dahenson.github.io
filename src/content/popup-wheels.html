<h2>The Wheels</h2>
<p>
  When Granny towed the popup to our house, she dropped it off with some
  instructions and a few things for us to checkout. Besides the obvious holes in
  the roof, she expressed concern for the wheel bearings. She said they probably
  needed to be re-greased to be fully road ready.
</p>

<h3>Bearings</h3>
<p>
  My dad had also expressed concern about the tires and the bearings. He had a
  story about towing a fishing boat down the road and having the bearings
  sieze up on the highway. Needless to say, there was smoke, rubber, and
  potential for a lot of damage. He didn't want me to make the same mistake, so
  he came down and got to work on the lower business half of the camper.

<p>
  These wheels are mounted to the hub with lug bolts that go through the rim,
  into the hub, and out of the back of the hub. Because the trailer had been
  sitting in a field for a few years, the end of the bolt threads had gotten
  rusty. This led to my dad working up a sweat to get both wheels off. After
  some spritzes of rust-away and some muscle power, the wheels were free.
</p>

<p>
  We pounded the dust covers off and found that the hubs turned freely, still
  had plenty of grease, and didn't appear to be damaged in any way. We decided
  to forego any more work and just pack more fresh grease into the bearings
  before putting the dust caps back on. We might revisit this again in the
  future, but <em>if it ain't broke, don't fix it!</em>
</p>

<h3>Tires</h3>
<p>
  I wasn't taking notes when Granny was talking about the tires. In my defense,
  I didn't think about the age of the tires until a year after we started
  the project. I'll spare you the boring details of worrying about whether the
  tires were too old for travel. Let me skip straight to the useful information.
</p>

<p>
  When a tire is manufactured in the United States and officially inspected by
  the DOT (Department of Transportation), they recieve a DOT stamp. This stamp
  indicates that the tire is in compliance with DOT and includes the week and
  year it was manufactured.
</p>

<p>
  The first two digits inside of the oval indicate the week of the year, and the
  second two digits indicate the year. In our case, the two tires and the spare
  had all been manufactured in the third week of 2019. Granny was always
  thorough and thoughtful, and we were ready to tow.
