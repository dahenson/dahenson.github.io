<h2>The Popup Project</h2>

<p>
  The popup camper is a Starcraft Starter 8' that was gifted to us by my wife's
  late beloved Granny.
</p>

<p>
  My wife grew up traveling the country in this little house on wheels, and we
  want to breathe new life into it so that we can carry on that tradition for
  our family. Here is a journal of our camper restoration.
