    <p>Dear elementary OS Fanatic:</p>
<p>I know, it's frustrating.  Luna is right there within grasp.  You are probably downloading the "unstable" daily and you have realized that it isn't as unstable as the devs might have you believe.  You run it on a daily basis to do real work (as I am now), but the elementary council just won't release.</p>
<h3>The Tale of the Power User</h3>
<p><em>But there aren't any bugs!!!</em> you scream, raging at the comments section on the latest drool-inducing journal post.  <em>I'm using it right now, and it's as stable as a rock!</em></p>
<p>Of course, there is that one little annoyance where you stick your favorite kitty wallpaper on your desktop and behold, <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/pantheon-greeter/+bug/1061235">you can't see it on the login screen</a>.  Instead, it's defaulting to that beautiful cloudy scene you remember from good old Jupiter.  <em>That's okay, I'll deal with it for now</em> you decide.  That is, <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/pantheon-greeter/+bug/1036484">until you try to read the current time</a>.  White on white just doesn't work for reading text.</p>
<p><em>Well, I'll just install the wallpaper to the system wallpaper directory so that my kitty picture is available globally.</em>  you say.  That would be fine until your mom sees what you've done and asks why she can't have her own picture on the login screen.  <em>It's not that simple, mom.</em></p>
<p>Do you see where I'm going with that scenario?  All of these little annoyances add up to larger issues that can't be solved by an average user.  I don't know if you've noticed, but the elementary team is indeed targeting the average user, while trying not to alienate the power user.</p>
<h3>The Bugs That Aren't Bugs</h3>
<p>I have been seeing a trend in comments on the elementary OS journal that say something like: "Why don't you just release?  There aren't any major bugs, and if there are, you can just have the users report them and you can update the PPA when you get it fixed."  This is what I would call a "Bug Bomb."  Drop a somewhat buggy distro on the unsuspecting populace and hope that they bomb it with bug reports until it gets sufficiently cleaned up.</p>
<p>First of all, you want my grandma to report a bug?  If I install elementary OS to a relative's computer, it had better work like butter or I'll be answering calls all day long about system crashes or disappearing windows/buttons.</p>
<p>The second, and biggest issue I have with that statement has to do with the fact that the Designers are at the top of the food chain in the elementary community.  If the Designers aren't happy, nobody is happy.  This is where the "bug that isn't a bug" comes in.  Developers and Power Users both have a similar view of bugs.  To them, bugs are issues that cause software to crash, or cause certain GUI elements to lock up.</p>
<p>If you were to examine the launchpad bugs, you would find that a majority of them pertain to how the user interacts with the system.  I'm not saying that these aren't bugs from a technical standpoint.  What I am saying is that a power user would overlook a lot of those small details because he/she is going to tweak the hell out of the system anyway.  Most distributions are written for Power Users by Power Users, with little focus on how all of the pieces fit together.  In elementary's case, the bar has been raised.  If a transition doesn't feel right or a button is a few pixels off, there'll be hell to pay, bugs are filed and developers get to work.</p>
<p>Designers, User Experience experts, and Developers of elementary are calling for more than just an amalgamation of hodgepodge software.  They are working towards an insanely beautiful user experience and that is why the "minor" bugs have become paramount.</p>
<h3>Lessons Learned, No More Bug Bombs</h3>
<p>I wasn't here when Jupiter was released, but I have heard enough from the developers to know that they have some regrets about how it all turned out.  I think they feel like the initial release was rushed.  Having used Jupiter myself before joining the community, I can vouch for the fact that it was a little rough around the edges.  We are still experiencing fallout from the great "dist-upgrade" debacle that caused quite a few people to have to re-install their systems.</p>
<p>From these experiences, the developers have learned that it is better to have an airtight release image than release and fix bugs later.  This means no more buggy dist-upgrades (if in fact they decide to enable dist-upgrades by default), no more kernel panics, and no more crashy default web browsers.  Of course, time has passed and much of the software has matured beyond these kinds of bugs more common among initial releases.</p>
<p>My hope is that the elementary OS user community can understand the painstaking work going on behind the scenes to release a smooth, tightly integrated computing experience.  After all of the effort put into the user experience, elementary just can't afford a bug bomb.</p>
