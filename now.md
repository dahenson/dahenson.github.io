This is a ["Now" page](https://sive.rs/nowff). It is a brief overview of what
is happening in my life at the moment.

Living
------
I live in Granbury, TX now.

My wife and I moved our family to a small(er) town in Texas so that we could
feel closer to our roots. We both grew up in small(er) towns--hers was
significantly smaller than mine. There is no idyllic lifestyle to fit every
human, but as soon as we got out of the city we felt at peace.

I might change my tune in the next 10 years as the DFW urban sprawl overtakes
and consumes Hood County, but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.

Working
-------
I currently work for [outstand](https://outstand.com). I love the company,
and I love my team!
