        <p><strong>Hi, Iâ€™m Dane!</strong></p>
        <p>
          I am a software engineer in Granbury, Texas. I enjoy working hard, learning
          new technology, and applying my skills to improve the world around me. I am
          passionate about helping people, loving people, and helping people love
          others.
        </p>
        <p>
          My most recent employer was <a href="https://dscout.com">dscout</a> where I
          worked as a software engineer.<br />
          My most recent work experience involved Ruby, Elixir, and some Javascript/Typescript
          in the form of ReactJS. However, I enjoy finding and learning the right tool for the job.
          I have dabbled in Go, Elm, Ada, C, Lua, and other languages of interest over the years in
          order to sharpen my skills and gain understanding for how different systems are built.<br />
          If you or somebody you know has need of a curious, thoughtful, and hard working engineer
          like me, feel free to ping me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dane-henson/">LinkedIn</a>.
          You can find me organizing some bits on <a href="https://github.com/dahenson">github</a>.<br />
          You can connect with me on <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@brainofdane">mastodon</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          On a more personal note, I like to <a href="/library.html">read books</a>
          and watch <a href="/indian-cinema.html">indian cinema</a>. I have been a licensed
          amateur radio operator since 2006. My call is  <a href="/ke5hcq.html">KE5HCQ</a>, and I occasionally enjoy
          finding interesting things to do with radios.
