    <p>The official elementary Answers system has been removed, which is awesome!  Why is that awesome?  It means the moderation team gets a little break from answering questions! (yay)</p>
<p>Actually, what it means is the elementary counsil has seen fit to retire Jupiter and start gearing up for a Luna release.  If you peruse elementaryos.org, you will see that they have made it much more difficult to find the download page for Jupiter and when you do get to the downloads page, you will see a placeholder.</p>
<p>Well, now that there is no place for people to ask questions, I thought it would be fitting to put up an unofficial FAQ.  Since I would normally be answering these questions on the official site, you're basically getting official answers--unofficially.  If you have any suggestions, feel free to let me know in the comments.  I know I haven't covered everything here.</p>
<p>Here we go...</p>
<h2>Questions About 0.1 (Jupiter):</h2>

<h3>Where can I get jupiter?</h3>

<p>To be honest, you probably don't want to use Jupiter unless you really know what you're doing.  It has officially reached end of life, and will no longer receive security updates.  The official elementary apps are not receiving updates either.  While it is still a beautiful system, you are probably better off just waiting for Luna.</p>
<p>If you are still not deterred, the official page is still up for historical purposes: <a href="http://elementaryos.org/jupiter">Jupiter Download Page</a></p>
<h3>Should I upgrade Jupiter to the latest version of Ubuntu?</h3>

<p>NO!  If the update manager pops up and says there is a new version of the operating system available, DO NOT UPGRADE!  This was an issue from the earliest release of Jupiter and will give you a headache if you let it perform the upgrade.  You may continue to upgrade packages, but do not do a full distribution upgrade.</p>
<h3>How do I customize XX and YY on my desktop?</h3>

<p>Not all support has been pulled from the elementary website and there is still hope for those of you wanting to tweak your Jupiter desktop.  Just visit the <a href="http://elementaryos.org/docs/user-guide">elementary OS User Guide</a> and learn about all of the wonderful things you can do to your desktop.</p>
<h3>Will I be able to upgrade directly from Jupiter to Luna?</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, that will not be an option in the elementary installer.  The elementary dev team just does not have the appropriate resources to build and test an upgrade system of that magnitude and the two releases are just too far apart to be compatible.</p>
<p>As a faithful and loyal user of Jupiter, we salute you and we are grateful for your support.  I recommend that you make multiple backups of your '/home' directory and any other important documents you might have on your system and perform a clean install when Luna is released.</p>
<h2>Questions About 0.2 (Luna):</h2>

<h3>When Will Luna Be Released?</h3>

<p><a href="http://elementaryos.org/journal/when-its-ready">When it's ready!</a> (TM)</p>
<p>Luna is nearing a Beta release as of this writing and you can track the progress of the Beta1 milestone on the <a href="https://launchpad.net/elementary/+milestone/luna-beta1">launchpad page</a>.  If you have what it takes to knock out those bugs, please do so.  I want to see Luna released just as bad as you do.</p>
<h3>Why doesn't the elementary team have a steady release cycle?</h3>

<p>This question is way too loaded to fully answer right here.  If you would like to read about why they haven't released Luna yet, refer to my <a href="http://www.brainofdane.com/blog/2012/10/05/elementary-cant-afford-a-bug-bomb/">earlier post</a>.</p>
<h3>Where Can I Get the Luna Daily?</h3>

<p>If you download the daily and use it on a production machine, kittens will die, civilizations will collapse, and your girlfriend will leave you.  I know it seems stable, but the elementary team only wants experienced testers and developers using the dailies.  You will <i>only</i> receive support from the <a href="https://launchpad.net/elementaryos">launchpad platform</a>.</p>
<p>Now that I have given you the obvious disclaimer, I will give you the link to the download page.  With great power comes great responsibility.  Use it wisely.
