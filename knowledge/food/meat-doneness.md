These temperatures are for grilling and cooking. Smoking is a whole other story. Always remember
that the internal temperature of the meat can continue to rise 5-10 degrees after being removed
from heat.

## Chicken

Chicken should always be cooked to at least 165℉.

## Pork

Pork should always be cooked to at least 145℉ in order to kill off the bacteria.

- 150℉ - 155℉ (Medium)
- 155℉ - 160℉ (Medium Well)

The USDA says that anything under 165 is "unsafe", but these are the accepted internal temperatures
for deliciously cooked-to-order beef.

- 130℉ - 140℉ (Medium Rare)
- 140℉ - 150℉ (Medium)
