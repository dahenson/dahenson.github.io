## Chicken

Chicken should always be cooked to at least 165℉.

## Steak / Burgers

The USDA says that anything under 165 is "unsafe", but these are the accepted internal temperatures
for deliciously cooked-to-order beef.

- 120℉ - 130℉ (Rare)
- 130℉ - 140℉ (Medium Rare)
- 140℉ - 150℉ (Medium)
- 150℉ - 165℉ (Medium Well)
- 165℉ + (Well Done)
