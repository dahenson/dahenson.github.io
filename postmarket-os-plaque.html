        I spent a little bit of time the other evening on a little 3D Printing project
        for my new Chromebox. The Chrome logo on the side of the Chromebox is
        misleading and I wanted to re-brand it with the logo for the software that it
        is <em>actually</em> running.
      </p>

      <p>
        My inspiration came from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kG_YKeJDaX8">youtube video</a>
        in which the creator Scott Yu-Jan is customizing his 3D Printer and he says:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Step 1: debrand</p>
        <p>– <cite>Scott Yu-Jan</cite></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        He then proceeds to spray paint the parts of the printer that are branded to
        obscure the logo. Well, I wasn’t about to spray paint the nice little black box
        so I figured I could at least “re-brand”.
      </p>

      <p>
        My OpenSCAD and FreeCAD skills are still lacking, so I knocked this one out in
        Sketchup. The logo is (sort of) free-handed, and may not be exactly right. To
        my eyes, it looks pretty close to the original. Overall, I’m pretty pleased with
        the result.
      </p>

        I changed the filament at layer 11 (with resolution set to 0.2mm) so that I
        could overlay the glow-in-the-dark background with some nice green filament.
        I don’t have a darker green, but I think the muted colors look nice.
