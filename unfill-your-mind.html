    <p>I just got back from a small vacation in Oregon.  I was there for a wedding, but it ended up being a nice family getaway in the green hills near Portland.</p>
<p>Instead of bringing my laptop and "enjoying the scenery" by writing code, I left it all behind.  Of course, I brought my Nexus 7 as a recreational tool, but I only really used it to check a few e-mails and keep up with a little news.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we just get so pent up and <a href="/restless.html">restless</a> that we can't figure out what direction we want to go.  Especially if you're both technical and creative.  Do you want to work on UX/UI for a new app, or pound out some code, or write a short story, or brainstorm a screenplay?  Maybe you want to do some woodworking or wrench on your car.</p>
<p>You just need a brain dump.  It probably won't involve traveling to another state, but even heading to your favorite coffee shop to talk with a friend can be a good enough break to clear your mind.</p>
<p>Life can get pretty hectic for me and I tend to fill every minute with something that keeps my brain in high gear.  Now that my vacation is over, I feel so much more focused.  I'm ready to prioritize and slow everything back down a bit.</p>
