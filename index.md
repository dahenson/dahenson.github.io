**Hi, I'm Dane!**

I am a software engineer in Granbury, Texas. I enjoy working hard, learning
new technology, and applying my skills to improve the world around me. I am
passionate about helping people, loving people, and helping people love
others.

You can find me organizing bits on [github](https://github.com/dahenson)
I generally avoid all other forms of social media. Instead you can
[e-mail me](mailto:thegreatdane@gmail.com).
