**Hi, I'm Dane!**

I am a software engineer in Granbury, Texas. I enjoy working hard, learning
new technology, and applying my skills to improve the world around me. I am
passionate about helping people, loving people, and helping people love
others.

I currently work for [dscout](https://dscout.com) as a software engineer. I write Ruby, Elixir, and some Javascript/Typescript.

You can find me organizing bits on [github](https://github.com/dahenson) and having meaningful conversations on [mastodon](https://hackyderm.io/@brainofdane).
I generally avoid all other forms of social media. Instead you can
[e-mail me](mailto:thegreatdane@gmail.com).
