This is my wishlist for Birthday/Christmas/Whenever. This is more for me to
keep track of stuff I want for myself, but it might give other people ideas of
what I like/want.

## Books

I usually have an up-to-date list of “want-to-reads” at
[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/5509110-dane-henson?ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=to-read).

## Just For Fun

I'm basically just a big kid.
