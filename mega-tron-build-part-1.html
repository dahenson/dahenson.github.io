      <p>
        My brother-in-law gave me his broken Creality Ender 3 v2 3D printer the other
        day. I was excited to get it home, confident that I would be able to fix it up
        and get back to my normal printing shenanigans. It didn’t take long to work
        some of the kinks out and run a couple of prints through it. Everything seems
        to be humming along nicely, and the prints are coming out clean.
      </p>

        But what do I do with my old trusty Folgertech 2020 i3? Crusty, somewhat
        temperamental, and long in the tooth, it’s probably hopeful for retirement.
        All of those “<a href="https://reprap.org/wiki/Category:Vitamin">vitamins</a>”–as they call them in the RepRap world–should not go
        to waste! So, with a fresh, working printer, I decided I would do the most
        sensible thing: print another printer!
      </p>

      <p>
        The youtuber (youtubist? youtubite?) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Fugatech3DPrinting">Shane (Fugatech)</a> designed a printer based
        around the very same Folgertech vitamins I wanted to repurpose. The printer is
        called “Mega Tron i3”, and you can download the printable parts on the printables
        web site: <a href="https://www.printables.com/model/54703-mega-tron-i3">Mega Tron i3</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        According to Shane, you should be able to tear down the Folgertech, print the
        necessary parts, and build the mega tron from the scraps. I am already
        andticipating a few issues with this plan.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, I seem to recall Shane receiving his printer with a few upgrades already
        installed, and I believe he may have added a few upgrades to the printer over the
        years. He is definitely not starting from a stock machine, while I definitely am.
        Second, he has already stated in the design that the printer is designed to use
        an upgraded control board without end stops, which means I either have to add end
        stops or upgrade my board.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also anticipate needing to upgrade my hotend, since the one I have is a little
        bit dated.
      </p>
      <p>I’ll cross those bridges when I get to them.</p>

      <p>
        Despite not having all of my marbles together, I went ahead an got started. I’ve
        always liked the idea of building a printer from scratch, which is why I bought
        the Folgertech as a kit in the first place.
      </p>

      <p>
        The other day, I spent an afternoon and completely disassembled my faithful old
        Folgertech. It was a good machine. I learned a lot of great lessons about FDM
        printing through trial and error with. Like a phoenix, it will be reborn from
        the ashes as a more powerful reflection of itself.
      </p>

      <p>Wish me luck, and stay tuned!</p>
