<h2>The Analysis</h2>

<p>
  The biggest issue with the camper was hail damage that was caused by a rogue
  Texas storm rolling through Granny's area. The storm had caused major damage
  to many of the houses in the area, and the roof of the popup had taken a
  similar beating. There were multiple holes that penetrated all the way through
  the roof and&mdash;despite Granny's best efforts&mdash;the interior of the
  trailer sustained quite a bit of water damage.
</p>

<p>
  Our initial inspection revealed worn, mildewed canvas and rotted wood surfaces
  in many of the essential areas of the camper. Not only were we going to have
  to rebuild the roof, we were also going to have to replace the canvas,
  counters, and air conditioner. This was not going to be a small job, and it
  was not going to be cheap. Despite the unfortunate news, we decided to press
  on.
</p>

<h3>Restoration Motivation</h3>

<p>
  I hesitate to put any kind of justification behind a project like this.
  Everybody has their own value system by which they measure everything they
  do. The popup camper is simply a sentimental <em>and</em> useful object that
  will add value to our family's life when it is finished.
</p>

<p>
  My wife will be able to travel across the country in the very same camper that
  she explored the country with as a child. I will be able to say I built parts
  of it with my own two hands, and I will be able to carry on my family's
  tradition of recreational camping. The value is not in the cost. The value
  is in the entire experience.
